TODO - rough path to functioning release build.


Necessary
---------------
- Encrypt account.bin/token.bin
- Remove (obviously) all hardcoded paths (C:\\Users\\owcar\\halcyon\\*)
- Manage Discord online status via their websocket. Think it's on the v10 api(?).
- - Simple ack heartbeat.
- - Curses(?) tui?

Would-be-nice
- Remove dependencies (cpr/rapidjson).
- - Rapidjson is actually quite nice.
- - cpr is rubbish. Has somehow ended up nearly 5x slower than curl.
- Doxygen?

Unsure/want to benchmark
- How much slower is std::string over char*?
- - Is it really worth the convenience?
- Smart pointers
- - I'm already fairly certain use of any of these in a simple program isn't worth it.

Things to never do in own code:
- Polymorphism
- - vtable lookups are still slow as fuck.

Why I don't adhere to "Clean code guidelines"
- Polymorphism is slow.
- Functions not being able to peek into the structures they are operating on is idiotic.
- - Without this you lose out on the ability to optimize what should be very very fast procedures.
- "No mutating state"
- - What? Just read the code and/or the comments to understand what's mutated where. This is retarded.
- "Don't call directly into implementation"
- - LOL!
