If software *can* be fast, it *should* be fast. If a piece of software *can* be fast, but isn't, it is a bad piece of software.

# Build

Currently requires vcpkg (Windows). Will address that once the project is ready for use.

The following are currently used, but will be removed soon enough:

```
vcpkg install cpr:x64-windows
vcpkg install rapidjson:x64-windows
```
